# Dead Simple Setup
The "dead simple" OSX package install script.

## Why?
I got tired of doing one off brew installs for java, ruby, python, npm, etc. I
like [thoughtbot's laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) but I think
it's too opinionated.

## Install

Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and git (after installing homebrew, `brew install git`).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:westonplatter/dead-simple-setup.git
cd dead-simple-setup
chmod +x ./setup.sh

#
# examples
#
./setup.sh personal_apps
./setup.sh personal_db
./setup.sh personal_ruby
./setup.sh personal_java
./setup.sh personal_scala

```
